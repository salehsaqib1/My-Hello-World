# My-Hello-World
My first repository on GitHub

My name is Saleh Saqib Fazal. I am a mechanical engineering student at McGill University.
I recently did a C programming course. With no prior knowledge, it was an overwhelming experience.
I enjoyed prigramming, not only for its math but also the goal of solving real problems with code. :smiley:
I do know some basics of matlab and java.
My activity as a member of the GitHub community depends on my future involvement with the art of programming. 
Thank you! :coffee:
